This is the beginning of a Review/Rate system. 

I'll add in the spec sheet shortly, but for now I just wanted to get it set up. 

Looking to utilize Node.js, and unsure what the backend will be.

I'm kinda curious about using Firebase, but if we scale it how the Spec sheet says, I'm afraid it will get too large
	for the free version and we will be screwed, and I'm not sure I'm willing to fork over 25/month for now.

We can throw together some WireFrames and drop them in here as well.
